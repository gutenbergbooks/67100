</div>


<p>Once there was a little boy named Bumps,
a name he was given because of the many times
he fell down, bumping his little legs and head.
He was a roly-poly little chap, a bit too heavy
for his height, and when he started off to work
or play he was usually in such a hurry that
he tumbled over. Now Bumps lived in a wee
hut &#8217;way off in the country, with his mother,
who was quite poor. In the mornings he would
hustle out to chop wood and gather wild berries
for their breakfast, always wishing that he
could find a pot of gold to make his mother
rich and happy. Finally he decided to start
out into the big world to seek his fortune, and
while his mother hated to have her little son
leave her, she felt sure he would be successful
because he had always been such a good boy.</p>

<p>So one bright sunny morning Bumps, after
kissing his mother good-bye, set out on his long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
journey with a rabbit&#8217;s foot in his pocket for
luck and only a little lunch to eat on the way.
He walked for miles and miles in the direction
of the city until his little legs grew very, very
tired. So he sat down to rest and to eat his
luncheon, only to find that he had devoured
it, bit by bit, as he trudged along. It was getting
toward the end of the afternoon when he
suddenly saw a little brown rabbit with a white
tail hopping along ahead of him. He longed
for the big gun which he had left behind in
the woodshed, for he knew that he must soon
have more food and he thought the rabbit
would make a good supper. But just then he
spied a stone with which he thought he might
kill Mr. Rabbit. Bumps threw the stone with
all his might, just missing him by inches, and
the rabbit, instead of running away, scampered
right up to him, and sitting up straight,
held out one little foot. Then it occurred to
Bumps that here he was carrying a rabbit&#8217;s
foot for good luck, and yet he had tried to
bring bad luck upon this poor little creature.
With tears in his eyes he gathered the rabbit
in his arms, calling him, &#8220;Dear little brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Bunny!&#8221; From that moment Bumps and the
Bunny were the best of friends, and journeyed
on together.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk by this time and
Bumps was so hungry that he began hunting
about in his pockets for crumbs of his luncheon.
When the little brown Bunny saw him do this,
and also saw that Bumps didn&#8217;t find anything
to eat in his pocket, he began running about,
pausing every now and then to sniff the air
with his little funny nose. At last he dashed
off at a great pace, and Bumps saw him busily
scratching and digging in the ground. When
he caught up with him he saw that Bunny had
uncovered a hidden basketful of the most delicious
things to eat, which a picnic party had
buried away in the cool, clean earth for another
day&#8217;s luncheon. Bumps and Bunny sat down
under a tree for supper, and Bumps fed his
little friend all the lettuce out of the sandwiches.</p>

<p>It was now quite dark and the two travelers
felt very drowsy, so they curled up close to
each other and fell sound asleep. Bumps was
dreaming happily about his return home laden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
with riches, when he felt something nibbling
at his ear, and awakened to find that Bunny
was trying to tell him something. He couldn&#8217;t
make out what the little fellow was trying to
say, until he heard a deep growl among the
trees, and saw a big shadow in the moonlight.
He was terribly frightened, but knew that the
wisest thing to do was remain perfectly still.
To his surprise, the Bunny scampered off right
under the nose of an enormous bear, making
all the noise he could in the dead leaves. Of
course, the bear ran after him through the
woods, which was exactly what clever Bunny
had planned, while Bumps stayed just where
he was, breathless with fright and excitement.
There was a great crashing and a terrific growling,
and then all was still! After a minute or
two Bunny reappeared, tumbling tail over ears
with laughter, and sitting up on his hind legs,
motioned Bumps to follow him. The two set
off together through the underbrush, and all
the while the frightful growlings grew louder
and louder, until they came to where they saw
old Mr. Bear stuck tight in a hole in the ground,
into which he had vainly tried to follow Bunny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
who had cleverly led him in and then escaped
through the hole&#8217;s back door. Bumps and
Bunny left the bear stuck securely in the
ground, fairly growling his head off, and went
back to sleep. Bumps felt fonder than ever of
Bunny, for he felt that the little animal&#8217;s quick
wit and quick action had saved his life.</p>

<p>In the morning the two friends proceeded
on their way, walking as fast as they could, for
they were in great haste to make their fortunes.
Occasionally they met a good farmer who gave
them apples and cabbages to eat. They walked
and walked all day long; sometimes Bunny ran
ahead over the roofs of the hills, but he always
returned to see if Bumps was following him.
And all the time Bumps&#8217; little legs were growing
stronger and stronger, so that he seldom
fell and hardly felt tired at all, which made
him very proud. Finally, Bunny vanished
over the top of the very last, highest hill, and
though Bumps looked and looked for him, he
didn&#8217;t come back. When Bumps caught up
with him he found him sitting on the doorstep
of a great river, wondering how they would
ever get across. Alas! Poor Bumps himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
could see no way to go on, and feared that
they would have to turn back. While they
stood sadly looking at the deep water as it
went rushing by them, there was a great splashing
and rippling all about, and hundreds of
fish, of every kind and color in the whole
world, poked their heads up above the surface,
just exactly as if they were trying to tell the
travelers something. Then Bumps and Bunny
noticed that the fish were floating side by side,
packed tightly together all the way across the
river in a long, glistening silver bridge. Bumps
had never heard of anyone crossing a river on
a bridge of fish, but he stepped boldly out, with
Bunny in his arms. And when he had safely
reached the other side, without even so much
as getting the soles of his feet damp, he thanked
the fish for their kindness by digging hundreds
of worms for them (with the help of Bunny&#8217;s
sharp little claws). As fast as they could dig
they threw the worms into the river, and just
as fast they disappeared into the fishes&#8217; mouths.</p>

<p>Then the two travelers resumed their journey,
telling each other how fortunate they had
been thus far. They went on and on, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Bumps thought they must be approaching the
city. They were pushing their way through
a little thicket&mdash;Bunny hurrying on ahead, as
usual&mdash;when Bumps heard the hiss of a snake.
He looked around quickly to see where it came
from, and right in front of him on the ground
he saw a poor little bird held spellbound by the
glittering eye of an ugly snake, so frightened
that it could neither move nor fly. Without
stopping to think that the snake might injure
him, Bumps seized a big stick and killed it.
Instantly the poor little bird was transformed
into a beautiful Fairy, not much bigger than
a robin. She told Bumps that a cruel Witch
had put an enchantment upon her, forcing her
to live in the body of a helpless little bird, at
the mercy of all the beasts of the forest, until
she should be rescued by some kind person.
The Fairy was so grateful to Bumps for her
release that she made him a present of a beautiful
purse, in which was just one shining gold
coin. This was the first money Bumps had
ever had for his very own and he felt that his
good fortune was coming true at last. Thanking
the Fairy politely, he skipped merrily on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
overtaking Bunny, and soon the two friends
were within sight of the big city.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first person Bumps and Bunny met on
their arrival in the city was a man selling ice
cream, and although he hated to part with the
gold-piece, Bumps could not resist buying two
fat cones. As they walked along eating them
and gazing at all the wonderful things about
them, Bumps&#8217; toes suddenly began to feel very
cold. Glancing down he saw that some of the
ice cream had dropped through a hole in his
shoe, which was badly worn from the long journey.
Right across the street there was a fine
big shoe store, and as Bumps stood wishing he
had a pair of handsome new shoes, imagine his
delight and surprise at suddenly feeling the
smooth, hard surface of another coin in the
purse the Fairy had given him! At first he
thought there might have been two gold-pieces
in the purse when the Fairy gave it to him
and he had been so stupid as to have only discovered
one of them. But when, after paying
for the shoes, he felt still another coin, he knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
that he had been given a wonderful gift indeed,
and that the purse was truly a magic one, which
would never become empty.</p>

<p>It was now an easy matter for Bumps to
buy all the pretty things he had planned to take
back to his dear mother, of which there were
so many that he had to buy a great balloon
to which was fastened a basket big enough to
hold everything. And Bumps and Bunny and
all the gifts purchased with the Fairy&#8217;s money
sailed away in it, over the wide river and all
the hills, until they came in sight of the little
home. Bumps landed the balloon in his own
front yard, and he and Bunny rushed in to
tell his mother the story of his good fortune.
She was delighted with all the presents he
brought her, and because they were never able
to empty the magic purse of its last shining
gold-piece, Bumps and his mother always had
everything they wanted, and lived happily
together forever after!</p>

</div>


<p>Whoops and Putty-Nose were at the seaside,
playing on the shore of a beautiful, big
blue bay&mdash;a bay which was really part of the
big, beautiful blue ocean, where their father and
mother had taken them for the summer.
Whoops was a very pretty little girl with long
yellow curls, and big brown eyes which were
almost always wide open with surprise. She had
been given her funny nickname because she
always cried &#8220;Whoops!&#8221; when she saw anything
that pleased her, and as almost everything
pleased her she was crying &#8220;Whoops!&#8221;
most of the time. Putty-Nose was her brother&mdash;a
jolly, fat little fellow with a round face
and a quaint snub nose in the exact middle of
it so covered with big brown freckles it looked
just like a lump of putty. Whoops and Putty-Nose
had a very small tent, buckets, shovels,
and a pop-gun, and had been playing that they
were Robinson Crusoe and his good man
Friday, cast away on a desert island. But after
a while they got tired&mdash;it was hard work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
imagining oneself quite deserted when one
could see home all the while! So they sat down
by the water to rest and to think up some
more interesting game.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Putty-Nose exclaimed,
&#8220;Whoopsie! Look at that big, round, flat rock
out in the water! Let&#8217;s wade out to it and we
can pretend it&#8217;s a really truly island!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whoops was always ready for fun, so they
waded out, carrying all their playthings in
their arms with them; they pitched their tent
in the very middle of the rock, and there they
were, really on an island, with water all around.
It was ever so much cooler than on the beach,
and much more exciting, so they sat down to
enjoy life and plan what to do next. Whoops
had just noticed that their rock was all marked
out in a diamond pattern, something like a
giant checkerboard, only not colored, when she
felt it begin to move smoothly and slowly
through the sparkling blue waters. Whoops
&#8220;whooped&#8221; in her very best manner, crying
out to her brother, &#8220;Hold on tight, Putty-Nose!
Our island is swimming away with us!&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing024.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Our Island Is Swimming Away With Us</i></p>

<p>And sure enough, the island was moving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
off to sea, making tiny ripples like those that
follow in the wake of a boat. The children
didn&#8217;t know what to do; they had never heard
of a swimming island, and they had just about
decided to become very, very frightened indeed,
when a big, long, ugly head lifted itself up over
the western shore of the island, turned, and
looked back at them. It was exactly like the
head of a turtle they had once seen, only a
great many times larger, and although it was
quite hideously ugly, it had a kindly humorous
expression around its mouth and a merry
twinkle in its eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Old Flipperoo, the sea-turtle,&#8221; it said
by way of polite introduction, &#8220;and I&#8217;m perfectly
harmless, so you mustn&#8217;t be afraid. You
can stay on my back and I&#8217;ll carry you across
the ocean to a place I know, and show you all
the queer and wonderful things that grow there.
Then I&#8217;ll bring you back safe and sound in
time for supper. How does that sound?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now of course, Whoops and Putty-Nose
said it was the one thing they wanted to do
most of all, so Old Flipperoo tucked his head
away out of sight again and set himself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
paddling away at a great rate. The mariners
were soon so far out to sea that they could no
longer see land, and when they passed close by
the great sea-going vessels and trans-oceanic
liners, all the people on their decks ran to the
rail to look at the queer flat boat and its very
youthful passengers. Everybody waved and
called greetings to the children, and the children
waved back, and shouted &#8220;Ship ahoy!&#8221;
which they knew was the polite thing to do.</p>

<p>After a long, long voyage they sighted a
land almost completely covered with the queerest
looking trees. Flipperoo swam into a quiet
bay and waddled right up on the sand, so that
Whoops and Putty-Nose were able to step
ashore without even wetting their feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
lie here in the sun and take a nap,&#8221; said the
turtle, &#8220;and you children start off on a journey
of discovery. Nothing in this strange country
will hurt you, although you will be surprised
at many of the things you will see. Only be
sure to come back here to me when you hear
the Tick-Tock bird calling, &#8216;Five o&#8217;clock!&#8217;, or
we&#8217;ll all be late for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Whoops and Putty-Nose left their wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
new friend dozing in the hot sand and
set off, hand in hand, along the path which led
up among the trees. Now they understood
why the island had looked so funny when they
were approaching it on the turtle&#8217;s back, for
all the trees grew upside-down, their roots in
the air, and the figs, cocoanuts, and bananas
on the ground, where they could easily be
picked. They decided to gather some of the
fruit on the way back to take home to their
father and mother, and went on up the winding
path. The air was full of Jujube and Lollypop
birds, which flew ahead of them calling,
&#8220;Whoops and Putty-Nose have come to visit
us!&#8221;</p>

<p>All at once they came upon a colony of
Chase-Tails, little striped animals with a very
sweet tooth. Instead of regular tails they had
sticks of peppermint candy, which they were
forever chasing round and round, in order to
satisfy their enormous appetites for candy.
Each Chase-Tail was chasing his tail for dear
life around a little bush, until every bush in
sight had a Chase-Tail lying around it like a
doughnut, holding its peppermint tail fast in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
its mouth, and nibbling away happily at the
candy. Just as Whoops and Putty-Nose were
wondering what would happen when the tails
were all eaten up, the Whispering-Tell-Tale
bird flew down and explained that new tails
would grow by tea-time next Thursday. It
was then only Monday, and the Chase-Tails
had to make their peppermint candy tails last
for four whole days, or go hungry.</p>

<p>Further on, in a cool little dell, they found
the Ice Cream Soda plant in full bloom, covered
with great white cup-shaped flowers, like Easter
lilies. All you had to do was pick one of these
flowers, wish very hard for your favorite flavor,
and instantly it was full of cold, delicious ice
cream soda. After sampling as many kinds
as they could think of, Whoops and Putty-Nose
continued their journey, and were just crossing
a bridge over a tiny stream when they were
brought to a standstill by a strange sound. It
came from the water, and, on looking closer,
the children discovered a school of Gurgling
Gonces swimming in a quiet pool under the
bridge. They ran down on the bank to see
and get a closer look, and were amazed to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
that a Gurgling Gonce is exactly like a small,
red rubber hot water bottle, and makes the same
noise a water bottle does when shaken. Putty-Nose
waded carefully into the stream and succeeded
in catching one of the funny fish. It
seemed not at all afraid&mdash;and very, very warm,
and it had just one big, round eye in the end
where the stopper of the water bottle would
be. It looked so pleadingly into his face and
seemed so helpless that Putty-Nose felt sorry
for it and put it back in the water right away.
&#8220;Gurgle-Gurgle,&#8221; said the grateful Gurgling
Gonce, very politely, and swam off to join its
brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>At last, just as Whoops and Putty-Nose
were beginning to feel very hungry, they
smelled a pleasant odor of cooking, and coming
out into a little clearing in the woods
where a fire was burning, they found dozens
of chubby little Waffle-Wimps dancing hand in
hand around it. The Waffle-Wimps were
square and flat, with little square holes all over
their plump little bodies. They kept dancing
closer and closer to the flames until they grew
crisp and brown and very hot. Then they all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
ran off sizzling and chuckling, each one crawling
under a marvelously sweet Syrup-Bush,
where he lay down on his back and let the bush
drip delicious maple syrup on him until he was
just prime for eating. The children ate all the
Waffle-Wimps they could hold, then they said,
&#8220;Thank You,&#8221; to the ones they left behind,
and went on.</p>

<p>They had a wonderful time getting acquainted
with all the strange and marvelous
creatures that lived on the island, but at last
it began to get darker and cooler in the woods
and they heard the Tick-Tock bird calling,
&#8220;Five o&#8217;clock! Five o&#8217;clock!&#8221; so they ran back
obediently to Old Flipperoo, who opened one
eye at them sleepily and asked, &#8220;Did you see
everything on the island?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Everything! And we loved it!&#8221;
cried the children. So Flipperoo promised to
bring them again, and crawled lazily back into
the water, preparatory to carrying them home.
Whoops and Putty-Nose, who were very tired
by this time, climbed on his back under
their Robinson Crusoe tent and lay down.
They fell fast asleep, and never woke up until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
they heard their mother calling to them from
the shore. You can guess how surprised she
was to see them come sailing home on Old
Flipperoo&#8217;s back, and to hear all about the
delights and wonders of their voyage to No-Such
Land.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Squeedinks and the Cod Liver Oil</span></h2>
</div>


<p>His real name was Ferdinand Maxwell
Higginson, but his friend Mops, the hired man,
always called him Squeedinks&mdash;and as we are
all going to be his friends&mdash;we may as well call
him Squeedinks, too. He lived with his aunt in
a pretty little house &#8217;way out in the country,
set between rolling green fields and a large
forest. Squeedinks used to read all sorts of
books, but he liked stories about animals best
of all. When he grew tired of reading he
would go out into the forest and watch the
squirrels frisking about among the old trees.
He noticed that most of the squirrels lived in
holes in the big oaks, and he was extremely
anxious to get a look into the holes and see
just how squirrels behaved when they were at
home.</p>

<p>After a great many unsuccessful attempts,
Squeedinks at last succeeded in climbing part
way up a big oak tree. He couldn&#8217;t get quite
as far up as the little round holes where he
saw his furry friends darting in and out, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
he was delighted to find one hole, low down
on the trunk, which was just big enough for
him to squeeze into. You see, he was just a
small little boy. Every day, after that, Squeedinks
climbed up to his lookout, which he
christened the &#8220;Crow&#8217;s Nest,&#8221; and sat there
with just his head peeping out, watching the
antics of the squirrels.</p>

<p>The squirrels would dash past Squeedinks,
chattering as if they were trying to tell him
something, and then scamper off home with a
great clatter and racket, looking down at the
little boy with their big, bright eyes. Squeedinks
always brought something for the
squirrels to eat, and it wasn&#8217;t long before they
grew quite friendly. He invented names for
the ones he knew best, and tried hard to teach
them to answer when he called.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing036.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>I Never Did Think This Tree Was Big Enough</i></p>

<p>One day Squeedinks heard his aunt talking
to the Doctor about him. She was worried
because he was so small, and the Doctor said
that he ought to take Cod Liver Oil to make
him grow. So that afternoon his aunt sent
him down to the village to buy a bottle. On
the way back from the village he came through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the forest, and decided he would climb up into
the Crow&#8217;s Nest for a while. He placed the
bottle of Cod Liver Oil carefully on the
ground, and was soon tucked &#8217;way up among
the leaves in his favorite lookout. As he sat
there, Squeedinks thought about the Cod Liver
Oil, and began to wonder if it would make
other things grow as well as little boys. He
leaned out of the hole to see if the bottle was
safe, and what do you think he saw? A funny
little brown man, not much taller than Squeedinks&#8217;
fox-terrier, Snarlyrow, was looking at
the bottle! Squeedinks heard him say to himself,
&#8220;H&#8217;m! Cod Liver Oil, eh? Well, I never
did think this tree was quite big enough for
its age!&#8221; And with that, he uncorked the
bottle, poured its contents on the roots of the
tree, and disappeared into the depths of the
forest whistling a funny tune.</p>

<p>Squeedinks was thinking that that was a
very strange thing to do, when he began to
feel rather queer. He felt as if he were going
up in an elevator, and the hole he was wedged
into grew larger and larger until it was as
big as a little room. He poked out his head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and looked down, and found that he could see
nothing but the green tops of the other trees,
far, far below him. What <i>could</i> be happening?
He knew! His tree was starting to
grow&mdash;the Cod Liver Oil had begun to work!
The tree grew so fast that in a few minutes
he could scarcely see the forest, or the roof of
his home nearby. The leaves of his tree grew
as big as bed quilts, and all the squirrel holes
were large enough for a small boy to live in.</p>

<p>It all seemed just like a fairy tale, and
Squeedinks became wildly excited. He could
now stand erect and walk about inside the
Crow&#8217;s Nest, and just here he noticed that the
big tree had a hollow center, and that this
hollow ran all the way up, just like a chimney.
He started to climb up the inside of the tree,
and quite unexpectedly found himself in the
front parlor of old Umbrella-Tail, a big gray
squirrel. All the squirrels were just as amazed
as Squeedinks at finding their homes grown
suddenly large and roomy, and they were all
chattering excitedly together. Squeedinks was
greatly surprised to find that he could understand
everything the squirrels said. Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Umbrella-Tail was saying, &#8220;Well! If you
expect me to keep house in <i>this</i> enormous
place you&#8217;ll just have to get little Nutty Red
squirrel for a servant! And that&#8217;s that!&#8221;
Then they all saw Squeedinks, and asked him
how he had got there. When he told them,
they said that <i>they</i> had always used the inside
of the tree for a stairway, but it had never
before been big enough for a boy to get
through, and they had felt safe from molestation.
Squeedinks assured them that he loved
squirrels and, indeed, all the animals that lived
in the woods, and wouldn&#8217;t hurt them for the
world. And now he only wanted to get down
and go home, for it was getting dark.</p>

<p>Old Umbrella-Tail said he would show him
the way, and started down inside the hollow
tree. Squeedinks followed more slowly, for it
was as black as ink in there. Finally they discovered
they couldn&#8217;t go any farther, and then
found they were inside of one of the tree&#8217;s
great roots, way down under the ground.
Then Squeedinks despaired of ever seeing his
home again, but Umbrella-Tail nosed about
and discovered an opening in the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
root, through which they could see a dark
tunnel leading away through the moist earth.
But they were afraid to follow it for they
didn&#8217;t know where it led, and were just
about to turn back in despair, when they heard
something thumping along with dull, rhythmic
bumps. It turned out to be old Grandfather
Mole, who lived down there. He was quite
blind, and had to walk with a cane, but his
front feet were big and strong, with sharp
little claws to help him dig his tunnels here
and there and everywhere under the ground.
When Grandfather Mole learned that Umbrella-Tail
was trying to get Squeedinks home
in time for supper, he turned slowly around
in his tunnel, handed the little boy a flashlight
out of his vest pocket, and called out in a deep
bass voice that sounded very much as if the
damp earth had given him chronic bronchitis,
&#8220;Follow me!&#8221; So Squeedinks bade Umbrella-Tail
good-bye, and started to wriggle along
the tunnel on his stomach behind Grandfather
Mole. In a marvelously short time they came
out into the air, and Squeedinks was delighted
to find himself at home underneath his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
front porch. He thanked Grandfather Mole
politely for leading him safely home, and
watched the old fellow disappear down his
tunnel again. Then Squeedinks ran into the
house and told his aunt all that had happened
to him, and what strange things the Cod Liver
Oil had accomplished.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Tom Now-You-See-Him-Now-You-Don&#8217;t</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a cold, snowy day just before the
Christmas holidays, and little Tom was standing
near one of the shop windows, gazing
longingly in at the beautiful gay toys. He
was wondering whether he would find the wonderful
red sled, shining skates and bright,
brisk-looking wagon under <i>his</i> tree on Christmas
morning, or if Santa Claus would hold
it against him that he had been naughty in
refusing, at first, to take his cough medicine,
and pass him by without leaving him any gifts
at all. Of course, he had taken the medicine
later, when his mother had insisted. But he
had heard that Santa Claus sometimes punished
children when they refused to obey promptly.</p>

<p>While he was pondering over this, selecting
the gifts he would like best and hoping to be
forgiven for his naughtiness, a huge snowball
sang by his head and crashed through the great
glass window. He turned quickly, in time to
see his playmate, Teddy, disappear around the
corner. Just then he felt strong hands grasp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
his coat collar roughly and heard an angry
policeman exclaim, &#8220;That&#8217;s the time I caught
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Tom! He knew that Teddy had
thrown the snowball, but he didn&#8217;t want to be
a tattle-tale, so he allowed himself to be hauled
away to the nearest jail. He was thrust into
a dark cell, not much larger than a clothes
closet, where he trembled with the cold and
dampness, utterly heart-broken over his sad
plight. Trying to be brave, he forced back the
tears, and settled down to wait until his father
should come to his rescue.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw a great cloud of smoke
rising from one corner of his cell. It circled
&#8217;round and &#8217;round until it disappeared into
thin air, leaving behind a tiny brown elf, who
stood blinking knowingly at him and nodding
his head like a wise little old man. Now Tom
had often heard of goblins and fairies and
wished that he might know them, so he smiled
at his little visitor, told him how glad he was
to see him and began to relate to him the
story of his misfortune. &#8220;Yes, Tom,&#8221; said the
little elf, &#8220;I know all about your troubles, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
because you have been a good, honest lad I am
willing to grant any wish you may make.&#8221;
This was jolly good luck for Tom, and he
laughed to think how worried he had been a
few short moments ago, and how the little
brown elf had transformed all his sorrow into
wonderful joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;O dear Mr. Fairy, what I want most of
all in the world is the power to become invisible,&#8221;
cried Tom. &#8220;I have always wished that
I could make myself invisible whenever I
wanted to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the little brown elf thought this a most
unusual wish, but he told Tom he would grant
it for one day, and instantly Tom felt a sudden
gust of air and found himself entirely alone.
Just then he heard the turnkey coming with
his bread and water and he hurriedly wished
himself invisible, and when the door was
opened he walked right out of his cell between
the big man&#8217;s bow legs! He chuckled in glee
to himself when he saw the turnkey looking
all about for him, not being able to find him anywhere,
and then he set about finding his way to
the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>On his way home Tom passed a lake that
the frost had converted into a solid sheet of
gleaming ice, where all the boys and girls were
skating. He spied a pair of skates lying on
the bank, and quick as a thought, he had them
on his feet and had darted off across the ice.
There were loud shouts of surprise from everyone,
and he saw all the boys and girls looking
after him in amazement. Of course, all <i>they</i>
could see was the skates, which they thought
must have been bewitched to go skating off
by themselves. A dozen boys set out in pursuit
of them, and Tom quite enjoyed the sport
of eluding them. Teddy, who was in the crowd,
almost caught up with him, but, hearing a
voice that seemed to come from the skates
themselves, saying, &#8220;You <i>know</i> you broke the
window!&#8221; he became so frightened that he
stumbled and fell, slithered over the thin ice
around a &#8220;Danger&#8221; sign, broke through and
plunged headlong into the cold water.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing048.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>All They Could See Was the Skates</i></p>

<p>Before the other boys and girls could reach
him, Invisible Tom had pulled him out. When
Teddy felt hands helping him out but could
see no one, he cried aloud in fear, but Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
just chuckled to himself and glided off, quite
satisfied with his first adventure. By this time
he was tired of skating, so, leaving the skates
where he had found them, he went merrily
and invisibly on his way.</p>

<p>A poor little homeless dog whose leg had
been injured by a passing truck was limping
painfully along ahead of Tom, and at last
tumbled into a pathetic little heap, unable to
drag himself further. A rough boy, whom
Tom did not know, came by just at that moment
and began tormenting the poor little
animal. &#8217;Twas then Tom thought he could
have some fun by befriending the dog and playing
a trick on the boy. So he dashed over,
picked the dog up in his invisible arms, and
carried him safely down the street. When he
looked back and saw the boy standing with his
mouth wide open in amazement at seeing a
dog floating away in the air, he laughed aloud.
This was indeed great fun! Tom went out
of his way to pass the Dog Hospital, where
he dropped his little charge carefully in through
an open window just high enough from the
ground for him to reach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Then Tom went on his invisible way. Soon
he arrived in front of Betty Brown&#8217;s house,
where he heard sounds of laughter and music,
reminding him that she was giving a party
and that he had been invited. He looked down
at himself. He had on his oldest suit, and he
knew he hadn&#8217;t time to go home to dress, so
he decided to attend the party as Invisible
Tom. The guests were just eating ice cream
and cake as Tom entered and he watched until
he saw the maid put down a big plate of chocolate
ice cream in front of Billy Bon. Before
Billy had a chance to notice it, Tom reached
out and snatched the dish, vanishing with it
behind the piano. Betty&#8217;s mother, the hostess,
was surprised to find that Billy had no ice
cream, and brought him another plate, but
Tom had eaten the first one quickly, and was
already standing invisible beside Billy&#8217;s chair,
waiting to play the trick again. This practical
joke was repeated several times, and poor Billy
might have gone ice cream-less if Tom had not
reached the very limit of his capacity at last.</p>

<p>During the games which followed refreshments,
Tom played many pranks on his little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
friends and then, politely saying good-bye to
Betty, who started at hearing a voice when she
couldn&#8217;t see anyone near, he skipped out the
door.</p>

<p>As it was now getting late, Tom knew he
had better hurry on home. He had enjoyed
being invisible so much that he decided to
remain that way as a surprise for his Mother
and Daddy. Upon reaching the house he saw
an enormous airplane, which had landed in a
field near his home and which was about to
take flight. Tom saw that it was piloted by a
famous aviator of whom he had often heard
his father talk, and he could not resist the temptation
of climbing invisibly in beside him.
Instantly there was a great roar, and they
were off up into the clouds, with Tom leaning
over the side of the plane to see the cities below,
which looked very tiny and very far away.
This was the greatest experience that Tom had
ever had, and in his excitement he forgot that
the aviator couldn&#8217;t see him, and shouted in
his ear, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go call on the Man in the
Moon!&#8221; This startled the aviator so that he
lost control of the plane, which shot toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
earth, twisting and turning in its terrible fall.</p>

<p>Over and over it went, with Tom clinging
to his seat with all his might, when all of a
sudden he lost his grip, and the next thing he
knew he had landed flop! in the middle of a
big, soft snowbank. A kindly old farmer who
was traveling along on the road nearby, hurried
to him, picked him up and offered to take
him home in his mulecart.</p>

<p>&#8220;O what a day!&#8221; thought Tom, and in his
heart he thanked the little elf for all his
thrilling adventures.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Colette, the Little Dancing Girl</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Far away in a distant city where all the
people love music and dancing, there was a
hurdy-gurdy man whom all the children knew
as Uncle Antoine. Uncle Antoine had a pet
monkey called Monko, who went with him
every day on his round of music-making.
One day, when the sun was shining brightly,
they chanced upon a pretty little blue-eyed
girl with golden curls, who was sitting on a
doorstep weeping. When Uncle Antoine asked
her why she was crying so bitterly, she replied
that she was all alone in the world and had
no place to live. Poor Uncle Antoine had a
great, big heart and he felt very sorry for her,
so he told her that he would be her uncle and
that she might join him and Monko.</p>

<p>Now Colette, for that was the little girl&#8217;s
name, was as good as she was pretty, and when
she found someone to love her and look after
her, she proceeded to dance for joy. A crowd
soon gathered, and everyone was so enchanted
with the music and the dancing that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
threw shining heaps of gold pennies into
Monko&#8217;s cup. At the end of the day they had
collected more gold pennies than Uncle Antoine
had ever seen in his life before, and the three
partners dreamed dreams of a beautiful future,
where pennies would be so plentiful that they
could afford to buy a nice little house of their
very own and live happily ever after.</p>

<p>So each night found Uncle Antoine, Colette,
and Monko &#8217;way off in the country falling
asleep under some nice big tree, tired but happy
in their dreams of the future. And every
morning they were awakened by little leaves
fluttering down upon their faces, and by the
chirping of the tiny birds above them. One
day Colette suggested going to the Zoo to
entertain the people who were watching the
animals, and since Uncle Antoine and Monko
were always ready to please her, they hurried
across the city, pushing the big hurdy-gurdy
before them.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing056.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Only a Tiny Bunch of Whiskers Remained</i></p>

<p>When they arrived at the Zoo they found
that great crowds were there before them, and
when Uncle Antoine started to play and Colette
to dance, not only did the boys and girls and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
grown-ups turn to look and listen, but all the
animals began to cut capers. The monkeys
started to two-step, and one old Grandfather
Ape did a loop-the-loop of joy. Old Leo Lion
whistled the <i>Star Spangled Banner</i> and the
big clumsy elephants sang <i>Yankee Doodle</i> all
at the same time; old Uncle Hippopotamus
humped about his cage, trying his best to
waltz.</p>

<p>Little Colette danced as she had never
danced before, with her lovely golden curls
flying in the breeze. Monko dashed around
through the crowd at a great rate, not knowing
what to make of the heavy silver dollars
that rattled merrily in his cup, taking the
places of the usual pennies. He emptied his
cup so often at Uncle Antoine&#8217;s feet that very
soon the hurdy-gurdy was surrounded by enormous
piles of gleaming silver dollars and when
it was dark, and all the people had hurried
home to their dinners, laughing and chattering
about their wonderful afternoon, Uncle Antoine,
Colette, and Monko were left behind
with so much money that they had to borrow
an elephant from the Keeper of the Zoo, strap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
a trunk on his broad back, and carry it all
away.</p>

<p>At last their dreams of wealth had come
true, and they set out in search of a little
house. They found a dear little vine-covered
cottage surrounded by shrubs and kindly trees
like the ones that had sheltered them in their
poverty. Colette had lots of fun making curtains
and preparing dinner for Uncle Antoine
and Monko, but the three friends missed their
old life. They missed it so sadly that at last
they decided that they would be happier if they
were still giving happiness to others, so they
began a round of visits to the orphan asylums
and the hospitals, and played and danced for
the poor little children and the sick and distressed.</p>

<p>One day while Colette was busily planting
seeds in her tiny garden, Prince Charming rode
by that way on his splendid white horse, and
he was so struck with her beauty and goodness
that he asked her to marry him on the spot
and become the Princess of his marvelous
castle.</p>

<p>Now Prince Charming was a wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Prince and Colette loved him, but she couldn&#8217;t
bear to leave her good Uncle Antoine and
Monko, who had befriended her when she was
sad and lonely. So she shook her head and told
the Prince that she must remain in the cottage
and watch over her family. Whereupon the
Prince laughed, and replied that his palace was
large enough for fifty families, and that he
would love hers as she did and look after them
always. And so there was a big wedding, with
Colette the most beautiful little bride in all
the world, dressed in glistening white satin
and creamy lace and carrying a huge bouquet
of the most exquisite flowers. And Prince
Charming was the handsomest groom imaginable,
in his uniform of gold and white. Then,
as soon as the ceremony was over, Colette,
Uncle Antoine and Monko all moved into the
Prince&#8217;s castle. It was a big, white castle, built
entirely of gleaming marble, with fountains
of diamonds and rubies playing in the midst
of gardens of rare flowers and trees so large
that they reached right up into the sky.</p>

<p>Uncle Antoine was the proudest and happiest
man alive, for the Prince had given him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
a brand new hurdy-gurdy which played every
tune that had ever been composed, and had
brought tears of joy into the old man&#8217;s eyes
by telling him that he might spend all his time
in the garden, playing his music, watching the
flowers, and listening to the birds, of which
there were millions, so tame that they would
sing any song you requested of them, and perch
on your hand to be fed. Monko was given all
the peanuts he could possibly eat, a whole grove
of cocoanut trees, and best of all, a kiddy-car
on which he could ride all over the grounds.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this glory they lived
very happily until Uncle Antoine grew to be
an old, old man, and Monko acquired a long,
white beard, which trailed behind him for
some three blocks. In fact, his beard was so
very long that when he went out walking with
the Princess Colette it looked like the train
of her gown. One day, when Uncle Antoine
and the Prince and Princess were all sitting
out in the garden listening to a large black
crow singing <i>Mammy&#8217;s Little Coal-Black Rose</i>,
they heard cries of anguish from high up
among the trees. They discovered that Monko&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
beard had become twisted around a tree trunk,
and that in trying to scramble down he had
jerked so hard that he had pulled out all but
a tiny little bunch of white whiskers. Poor,
poor Monko! He was terribly distressed, until
Colette assured him that his beard would grow
again, or, if it did not, she would paste the old
one on with molasses and he would be as handsome
as ever.</p>

<p>So you see, because little Colette and Uncle
Antoine and Monko had always done their
very best to make everyone about them as
happy as they could, they were allowed to
spend the rest of their days in the beautiful
palace with the good Prince.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Jerry and the Wishing-Ring</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry was a handsome little boy, and had
just celebrated his fifth birthday. His Uncle
Jack, who was a Naval Officer on one of Uncle
Sam&#8217;s battleships, was expected home from a
trip around the world, and Jerry was so
thrilled and excited that he could scarcely wait
for the actual time to arrive. He remembered
sitting on his Uncle Jack&#8217;s knee when he was
a wee little chap, listening to stories of the sea,
and he had not forgotten his Uncle&#8217;s promise
to take him on a voyage when he was five years
old. And then one day he heard the old
familiar whistle sounding on the garden walk
and, sure enough, there was his big Uncle looking
brown and strong, greeting them all with
smiles and kisses. He was to be home for just
one day, but that was time enough to have
Jerry fitted out with a smart sailor suit and
made ready to take the next trip with him.
Jerry had never known so much excitement,
and when he bade good-bye to his mother and
daddy and went aboard the battleship there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
not a prouder or happier boy in the whole
world.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t take him long to make friends
with the men aboard, and to learn about the
big guns and all the other fascinating things.
There was one huge sailor named Jim Seaweed
to whom Jerry was devoted because he was not
only the best boxer but the strongest man
on the ship. On the second day, when they
were far out at sea, Jerry came on deck just
in time to see old Billy Goat, who belonged to
his friend Jim and was also the ship&#8217;s mascot,
thrown from his feet by the lurching of the
vessel, and start sliding toward the rail, overboard.
Jerry dashed across the deck in a great
hurry, seized old Billy by his horns, braced his
feet against the rail and held him firmly until
some sailors came to their rescue. Jim Seaweed
was immediately informed of Jerry&#8217;s deed and
quick wit, and was so grateful to him for
saving his pet that he gave Jerry a wonderful
ring which had been a gift to him from a
Persian king. He explained that it was a wishing-ring,
with the wonderful power to bring
true your every wish.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Soon the ship was sailing far away through
tropical waters, and Uncle Jack gave orders to
anchor. In the distance they could see a group
of little islands set like tiny jewels in the blue
sea, and a party of sailors got permission to
take Jerry and go ashore in a small boat, to
explore. When they landed they found quantities
of tropical fruits and birds, but no signs
of human life. Tired of the company of the
others, Jerry set off by himself through a
wooded stretch, and had gone some distance
when he suddenly beheld a beautiful little girl
standing in the doorway of a tiny hut. Her
clothes were tattered and torn, but her hair
was the color of spun gold and her eyes were
the loveliest he had ever seen. She smiled at
Jerry and told him her name was Pam, and
that she had been shipwrecked and cast ashore
on this deserted island.</p>

<p>It was then Jerry thought of the wishing-ring
on his finger, so taking hold of it he said,
&#8220;Wishing-ring! Wishing-ring! Please dress
Pam in the clothes of a princess and change
her hut into a lovely palace!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was no sooner said than done, and both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
children danced for joy at the transformation.
Pam&#8217;s clothes were of silk and lace, and the
palace was of white marble, complete with
everything the heart could wish. Then it was
that Jerry learned that Pam was indeed a real
princess, who had been taking a trip with her
governess when they were shipwrecked, and
that her father and mother believed she had
drowned.</p>

<p>By this time the sailors had joined them,
and stood blinking their eyes in astonishment
at the wonderful sight. Jerry told them that
he liked the island and intended to remain
there for a while. He sent word back to Uncle
Jack on the ship that they should sail without
him, as the wishing-ring would take good care
of him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing068.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The Savages Ran in Terror</i></p>

<p>Pam and Jerry waved good-bye to the big
ship as it sailed away, and then turned about
to make a complete tour of their island home.
It was indeed an island of wonders, full of
strange and wonderful beasts and flowers and
fruits. They tied knots in the giraffes&#8217; necks,
and taught the ostriches to prance around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
island drawing the beautiful chariot which the
good old wishing-ring had brought them.</p>

<p>One day when Jerry was up in the tower
of the palace looking out over the ocean he
heard Pam calling, &#8220;Jerry! Jerry! Come
quickly and save me! Some savages have just
landed on our island!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry was down in a jiffy, to find that their
castle was being besieged by a band of cannibals
from a nearby island. Thinking fast, he
wished on his ring that he might be turned
into an enormous elephant with three long
trunks. Instantly, his wish was granted, and
the savages ran for their canoes in terror as
they saw this terrible animal charging at them,
shooting streams of water in their faces from
one trunk, followed by clouds of sand from the
second trunk, and succeeded by mammoth rocks
from the third. All this was great fun for our
two little friends, and when Jerry changed
back into himself, he and Pam laughed with
glee to think of how easily they had routed
the enemy.</p>

<p>They lived a life of perfect happiness on
their island, until Pam began to show signs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of homesickness for her father and mother,
and then Jerry decided to take her back home.
They discussed ways and means, and at last
agreed that an airplane would be the best thing
to wish for. Jerry had traveled over land and
sea but until now he had never flown through
the air. When his wish for the airplane had
been granted and they were about to set forth
on their journey to the kingdom of Pam&#8217;s
father, there were tears in their eyes at the
thought of leaving their fairyland.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t take them long to reach Pam&#8217;s
home, and when they landed the people went
crazy with joy at seeing their own little lost
Princess again. There was a great celebration
in honor of her safe return, and the King and
Queen were so grateful to Jerry for bringing
back their daughter that they made him a
Prince. Then Jerry wished hard for his own
father and mother, who instantly appeared and
lived with him in his kingdom until he grew
to be a man.</p>

<p>In time he married the Princess Pam, and
they decided that they would be happiest back
on their dear little island. So they sailed back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
in a big ship with scores of their friends, and
there they reigned as King and Queen, living
happily for the rest of their lives.</p>

IN BIRDLAND</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Patsy Ann in Birdland</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Patsy Ann was a quiet child, who never
romped with other children, but loved to roam
around her own garden looking at the flowers
and birds. Even as a tiny child, her nurse had
noticed how readily she made friends with the
little robins and bluebirds that lived in their
beautiful gardens in the spring and summer.
At the age of seven Patsy Ann had lost none
of her fondness for birds. She spent hours
going about with crumbs, calling to them in
her sweet little voice, and smiling with happiness
when they fluttered down to eat out of
her hand. <i>She</i> never found it necessary to
carry salt to sprinkle on their tails in order to
catch them, but was so gentle and kind that
the birds were always glad to fly to her.</p>

<p>One day, when Patsy Ann was out walking
with her nurse, they passed by a dense forest.
Her nurse explained that it was supposed to
be enchanted, because of strange sounds that
could be heard coming from its depths, and
that no one ever walked through it. The bright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
eyes of little Patsy Ann grew big with wonder
as she listened, and when Nursie stopped to
chat with a friend she stood staring curiously
in among the big trees. Then Nursie started
off down the road, thinking Patsy Ann was
walking by her side. After a while she turned
to speak to the child and lo! she was nowhere
to be found. The poor nurse was frightened,
and started frantically to call, &#8220;Patsy Ann!
Patsy Ann!&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time Patsy Ann had been standing
just where Nursie had left her, staring into
the forest. Hearing her name called, she
turned to look for Nurse, but could see her
nowhere. The cries of &#8220;Patsy Ann&#8221; grew
louder, and seemed to be issuing from the very
heart of the woods. &#8220;O what fun!&#8221; she
thought, &#8220;Nursie has gone into the forest, and
now I can follow her!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/facing076.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>A Queer Bird Flew Close to Patsy Ann</i></p>

<p>As she went up the path between the big
trees the calls of &#8220;Patsy Ann&#8221; came nearer
and nearer, and she was thinking that her nurse
must be close by, when she came upon an enormous,
brilliantly-colored parrot, and she burst
into laughter as she realized that it was the big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
bird that had been calling her. &#8220;O Polly!&#8221;
said Patsy Ann, &#8220;have you seen my nurse?
I thought it was she who was calling me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The parrot had heard the calls of the
nurse, and had been mimicking them, so he
only blinked very wisely and told Patsy Ann
that her nurse was searching for her, up and
down the road, very much worried because she
could not find her. He went on to say, &#8220;Of
course, you must obey your nurse, but I know
you love birds, and this forest is full of the
strangest ones you ever saw. We can send a
note to Nursie by the Carrier Pigeon, asking
her please to wait while I show you Birdland.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patsy Ann was delighted with this idea, and
she watched the parrot, fascinated, as he picked
up a large, dry leaf and whistled for the Fountain
Pen Bird. A little black bird with a shiny
gold bill appeared instantly, and flew right
into her hand. The parrot told her to hold
him just like a fountain pen and write on the
leaf with his bill. She thought this very funny,
but did exactly as she was told, and sure enough,
she was able to write with him just as if she
was sitting at home at her own little desk. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
a few minutes she was watching the Carrier
Pigeon fly away to Nursie with the note
wrapped around his leg.</p>

<p>Patsy Ann and the parrot then started off
to see the sights. First they came to an enormous
tree and the parrot asked Patsy Ann if
she could see anything in it. When she answered,
&#8220;No, Polly,&#8221; he handed her a pair of
amber glasses to put on, and immediately the
tree appeared full of Fluttering Kafouts, which,
he explained, were quite colorless and invisible
to the naked eye. Then they passed over a
brook where a Submarine Bird was just about
to submerge, but when he saw Patsy Ann he
said, &#8220;I know what you&#8217;d like!&#8221; and dove &#8217;way
down into the clear water, coming up with a
bright red balloon in his beak, which he gave
to her.</p>

<p>Just then she heard someone calling, &#8220;Cream
of Wheat! Cream of Wheat!&#8221; and wondered
whatever it could be. Polly told her it was
the Breakfast Bird, who would not only bring
you Cream of Wheat, but eggs in every style.
If you whistled once you got a soft-boiled egg,
if you whistled twice you got a hard-boiled egg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
and if you turned a somersault he knew you
wanted them scrambled. Patsy Ann was feeling
a bit hungry, so she whistled twice, just to
see if what Polly said would really happen.
Sure enough&mdash;a queer-looking bird flew close
to her and dropped a nice hard-boiled egg right
into her outspread apron.</p>

<p>While she was walking along eating it, the
parrot stopped to call her attention to a ragged
little fellow, which he told her was the famous
Early Bird. It was wearing an old, tattered
overcoat with dozens of pockets, and every
pocket was overflowing with worms. He was
always the first bird up in the morning, and
that was why he was able to catch so many
worms.</p>

<p>Most of these birds were perfect strangers
to Patsy Ann, and she was wondering what
funny thing would happen next. It happened
to be the Fizzwikle, who flew about her and
made her very thirsty indeed by sounding his
fizzy note, which was just like the noise made
by a soda water fountain.</p>

<p>This was all very interesting, and Patsy
Ann would have loved to spend the entire day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
among these strange creatures, but she knew
she must hurry back to her nurse. The parrot
said he would send her back by the Flivver
Bird. He called &#8220;Taxi! Taxi!&#8221; just as loud
as he could, and instantly there was a terrible
rattle-te-banging in the air above them and the
Flivver Bird landed in front of them. He was
the biggest bird Patsy Ann had ever seen. His
wings seemed to be made from pieces of old
tin roofs, which rattled when he flew, and he
had a terrible cough. The parrot helped her
get onto the bird&#8217;s back, and politely invited
her to come again. They were off before she
was able to thank him, and the ride through
the woods was noisy and exciting. When they
reached the road she slid off the bird&#8217;s back
and ran into her nurse&#8217;s outstretched arms,
pouring out the story of her wonderful visit
to Birdland.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
